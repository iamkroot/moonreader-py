# Moon Reader Scripts

Extracts information from the backups generated by the Moon+ Reader Android app.

I mainly use it to generate stats about how much reading I have done each day ([showed here](https://iamkroot.github.io/about#my-reading-activity)). As a result, it does not promise to cover every part of the databases present in the backups; only picking out the relevant info. Raise a PR if you'd like to extract more info

## Features
* Clear pythonic interfaces to model the information
* Supports specifying a `.gitignore` style file to exclude certain files from the generated summary
* Specify a `manual.toml` file to include books from other mediums into the stats
